Performance Testing plan


1. Objectives
   => Depending on the system under test
   => Sample testing a web application 
   I. Verify application can handle user load.
   II. Response time within limits.
   III. Identify performance issues.

2. Scope
   => Scope testing should be clearly defined in the performance testing plan.
   I. Component System
   II. Type of performance test
   III. Metrics to measure

3. Methodology
   => depends on the objective of testing and system under test
   -Load Testing
   -Stress Testing
   -Endurance testing

4. Test Scenarios
   => define to simulate realistic user behavior during testing.
   => Sample for an e-commerce website scenarios include
   I. browsing products
   II. adding items to cart
   III. checking out
   => expected load, duration

5. Test environment
   => The  test environment should be setup to simulate the production environment as closely as possible
   
6. Tools
   => Identify and technologies should be identified and includes in the test plan
    
7. Timeline
   => Timeline for performance testing project should be clearly defined
    Start date, End date before the production release date



Test Strategy Document

1. Test Types
  => Types of performance tests to be conducted should be defined

Load testing - to test the systems ability user load
Stress testing - handle peak loads
Volume testing - test the system with large data

2. Test approach
   => approach for each type of test should be defined in test strategy document
 
Load test - ramp up, steady state, rampdown
Stress test - Peak load level/ duration of test

3. Performance Metrics
   => performance metrics should be defined in test strategy document

   -response time, throughput, error state, resource utilization.

4. Test Data
  => define the test data such as user data, input data, test config.

5. Environment and infrastructure
  => hardware, software and network setup


Questions before creating test plan

Q1. How do we determine the objectives of Performance testing?
   => goals and needs of the system
   => identify key objective by working closely with stakeholders


Q2.What types of performance tests to be included?

Load testing - to test the systems ability to handle certain number of concurrent users

Stress test - to test the systems ability to handle peak loads.

Endurance test - to test the systems performance over extended period of time

Volume testing - to test the systems performance with large amount of data

Q3. What should be included in the test scenarios for performance testing
=> test scenarios for performance testing should simulate realistic behavior on the system under test.

Q4. How should the performance testing environment be set up?
=> it should be set up to simulate the production environment as closely as possible.

Q5. What tools and technologies should be used?
=> Depends on the system under test and objectives of the testing.
